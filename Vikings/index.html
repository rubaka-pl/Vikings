                                "Vikings" is a magnificent historical series, one of the best in its genre. The show
                                boasts
                                a huge fan base and has reignited interest in history, reviving the trend for Vikings.
                            </p>
                            "Vikings" was commissioned by the American channel History, but it was produced by Canadians
                            and Irish. The series impresses with its epic battle scenes, solid and deep storyline, and
                            meticulous attention to historical accuracy. The creators of the series spent a lot of time
                            and money (the budget for the first season was $40 million, and it increased in subsequent
                            seasons) to make the Vikings and their contemporaries look as they did in the 8th and 9th
                            centuries. On the other hand, the absence of precise historical facts and the
                            (semi)legendary nature of many events allowed the creators of the series to take liberties
                            with the interpretation of many events.

                                <p>
                                    According to the Seer, Ragnar was born and raised in the lands near Kattegat, in
                                    southern
                                    Norway, and earned a reputation as a clever boy. When Ragnar was fifteen, King Froh
                                    of
                                    Svealand invaded Norway and killed the Norwegian King Siward.
                                <p>Ragnar joined with
                                    Siward-loyalists to drive out Froh. King Froh was famous for carrying tame serpents
                                    around
                                    his neck in battle who would bite his enemies while he fought them. For the purpose
                                    of
                                    fighting Froh, Ragnar fashioned a coat and breeches from a hairy animal hide. In the
                                    battle
                                    that followed, Ragnar faced off with Froh and the serpents could not bite through
                                    the
                                    hide
                                    because of all the hair. Thus, Ragnar earned his name "Lothbrok," which means "the
                                    hairy-breeches."

                                    She is the mother of Björn. Lagertha is an Earl and a fierce shield-maiden.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Lagertha was brought up by her father to be a shield-maiden. At an unspecified time,
                                    Ragnar
                                    went to Lagertha's home to confess his love for her, but he was set upon by a bear
                                    and
                                    an
                                    enormous hound who guarded her home. Ragnar killed the bear with his spear and
                                    strangled
                                    the
                                    hound with his bare hands, thus gaining her hand in marriage. It is unknown whether
                                    Ragnar's
                                    story is real or a child-friendly tale to his son Björn referencing his battle with
                                    Rollo,
                                    who was known as a "bear", over Lagertha's love, as Lagertha also had a relationship
                                    with
                                    Rollo and is unsure who Björn's biological father is.

                                <p>Athelstan is a young
                                    Anglo-Saxon Christian monk taken as a slave by Ragnar Lothbrok from the Lindisfarne
                                    Monastery. He is torn between Viking and Christian beliefs</p>
                                <p>
                                    Athelstan was born to Northumbrian parents who already had four sons and a daughter,
                                    and
                                    couldn't afford yet another child in their home. So, he was placed in the
                                    Lindisfarne
                                    Monastery. Eventually, Athelstan found happiness, great freedom, and joy in serving
                                    the
                                    head
                                    of the monastery, Father Cuthbert. He had learned to forget about himself and has
                                    devoted
                                    his life to Christianity. Living in the monastery also saved him from possibly dying
                                    of
                                    fever like the rest of his family.
